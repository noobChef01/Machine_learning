Glowing
Swapn kutia, Mannagar is in Diwali.
Today you became a Jyotsna, filled it with me.

Lapful
Dirt frozen
Tapan for many years, then Deepa was born

See you
Yun felt wick
Kambulaiyang Wishes Agnidharma

As soon as any deer
Always known well-known smell
In that way I took your form in memories.
Today you became a Jyotsna.

In the flesh
An unfulfilled thirst roam
When is the exhaustion of exile?

Till date
Non-linear line
That is why do not you become less dedication.

Across the aisons
You took the place in the Jhilmil scene
From today I am Dehi and you are Deepamala
Today you became a Jyotsna.

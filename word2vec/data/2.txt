You want to burn a lamp on our door,
Good thing, but
Why the lamp of that lamp is sunny from our blood!

Somewhere
First, send darkness first,
Then sell the stars briskly and sell them.

In jail
The sun asks for release,
Or the gross sky you dance in the courtyard.

So do not you want to get to heaven,
Good thing, but
Why is that heaven's ladder made of our bones!

Do we know
Then again, in the celebration of the night,
Okay next morning, get your sleep in life again.

Shanty trade
What would you do if it started?
And how long will we fill the tears in the awful Nayan?

You want to wake us up,
Good thing, but
Now it is sticking to our skins on that nagad!

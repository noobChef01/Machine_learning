When you get wet
Assuming the song became a mask.
Like rain falls down to the ground
In the love of the heart of mind

This supernatural thing will be found in this rain
He is not in any church mosque or Shiva.

See you sitting on the banks of river
Break the coast will find some waves
Assuming that these are the songs of the song
O Mukhalati Dhar will get flowers.

The lesson of love taught by Nadiya
The teacher is not in any such school.

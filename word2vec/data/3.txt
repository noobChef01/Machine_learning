Sing me sing me sing
But the mind is unkempt.

Saved for many years
There is a cover of moonlight on moonlight.
Where to go is to ignore
Laxman is a faint heart.

If you have a heart of Drona mountain
Again
You become sanjivani
Come on come come come come
There is incomplete consciousness.

You came off and left, even today
Weave the pavani with tears.
Have said that the team is on the lips of this
At the time when I look for the elasticity.

You do not have to return
Eternally in the valley
Do not go go not go
That voice is to sound


And how long I will sing to you
Now you talk about your euphemisms.
Now you have a new subtype of love
Breaks out of Alakapuri

Meghdoot's practice is not even now
So you agree
Do not go go sing me
This is the verdict.

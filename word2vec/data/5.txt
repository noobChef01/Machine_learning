What is birth! Bus
Conversion of ice into the river,
And the lifespan of life's age,

Some light
Brings rainbow colors in life,
Something dark darkens in the eyes,

To balance
Only the burden of the mind of the mind,
It is the defeat of time that some people say
The beginning or final phase of fortune or misfortune
What is birth! Just conversion into river ice.

Then same
The forest has got but finding the path is again.
This birth also has to wander in the yearning of crossing.

Experienced fox
Tells that the jungle floats
Life flows from the Island of Wish.
Overall, the snow has to die again
What is birth! Just conversion into river ice.
